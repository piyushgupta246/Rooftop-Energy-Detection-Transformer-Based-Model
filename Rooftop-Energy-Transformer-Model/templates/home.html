            About the Model
        </h2>
        <div class="about-content">
            <p>
                This application utilizes a sophisticated deep learning model to analyze satellite imagery and identify rooftops with high solar potential. The model is designed to be a powerful tool for homeowners, businesses, and researchers to assess the feasibility of solar panel installations.
            </p>
            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Image Preprocessing:</strong> When a GeoTIFF image is uploaded, it is first preprocessed to match the input requirements of the model. This includes resizing, normalization, and channel selection.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Rooftop Segmentation:</strong> The core of the application is a U-Net-based semantic segmentation model. This model has been trained on a large dataset of satellite images to accurately identify and segment rooftops from the surrounding environment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Solar Irradiance Data:</strong> The application integrates with a solar irradiance database to fetch the average solar energy received at the location of the uploaded image. This data is crucial for calculating the potential energy generation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Potential Calculation:</strong> The segmented rooftop area is combined with the solar irradiance data and user-defined panel specifications (efficiency, etc.) to calculate the estimated annual energy generation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Visualization:</strong> The results are presented in an intuitive and interactive way, with the segmented rooftops overlaid on the map and key metrics displayed in a clear and concise manner.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Model Architecture</h3>
            <p>
                The model is based on the U-Net architecture, which is a popular choice for image segmentation tasks. It consists of an encoder path to capture context and a decoder path to enable precise localization. The model has been trained using the Adam optimizer and a combination of Dice and Focal loss to handle class imbalance.
