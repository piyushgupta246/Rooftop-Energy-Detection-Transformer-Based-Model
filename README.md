## About Model
The **Rooftop Energy Detection Transformer Model** automatically identifies rooftops from satellite images and estimates the potential solar energy output.  
Key functionalities include:  
- **Rooftop Segmentation** ‚Äì Detects and highlights rooftop areas using a Vision Transformer (ViT) based deep learning model.  
- **Energy Estimation** ‚Äì Calculates solar panel placement feasibility and potential energy generation using rooftop area and solar irradiance data.  
- **Urban Planning Support** ‚Äì Helps energy companies, governments, and individuals assess solar power feasibility.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
The working pipeline can be summarized in four major steps:  

### **1. Input Image**  
- The user provides a satellite image of a region.  
- Preprocessing steps: resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.

### **2. Rooftop Detection (Transformer Model)**  
- A **Vision Transformer (ViT)** extracts features from the image.  
- A **segmentation mask** is generated, highlighting rooftop regions.

### **3. Energy Potential Calculation**  
- The rooftop area is computed from the mask.  
- Solar irradiance and panel efficiency data are applied to estimate energy output.

### **4. Output**  
- **Segmented rooftop mask** (visual highlight of rooftops).  
- **Energy potential metrics** (kWh/year).
